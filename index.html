            <p>Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives, from our health and how we learn, to how we do business and make decisions, to how we connect with one another. As more and more of our lives become digital, we’re living in a world that's becoming increasingly devoid of emotion. We struggle with striking a balance between using our devices and reclaiming our emotions.</p>
            <p>Instead, why not bridge the two and make technology more responsive?</p> 
            <h3> What if our devices could understand our emotions?</h3>

        <h3>Lotus is an app that can read your face and respond to your emotions. </h3>
        <p>Your devices could now sense how you feel and react accordingly, just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would. This is especially helpful when you are feeling upset, angry, dead inside, or any other kind of negativity.</p>

            <h4>Reading Your Face</h4>
            <p>The human face is one of the most powerful channels that we use to communicate social and emotional states.</p>
            <p>Lotus’ algorithm finds your face and detects your facial muscle movements.</p>

    	<h4>Identifying Your Emotional State</h4>
            <p>The app reads each muscle movement as an emotion data point and compiles the information on a clean interface.</p>
            <p>It clearly communicates what you’ve sometimes have trouble articulating yourself: the emotional, the personal, the subconscious, and the existential.</p>
            <p><span>Concerned about accuracy?</span></p>
            <p>Don’t worry — we have the largest emotion database in the world, containing 12 billion data points. We've collected it from 2.9 million people in 75 countries who have agreed to share their emotions with us. It's growing every day.</p>

            <h4>Improving Your Emotional Health</h4>
            <p>Based on your current emotional state, Lotus responds with short games that have deliberate interactions designed to improve your emotional and psychological state.</p>
            <p>The games are straightforward, so you can just focus on the activity and let go of everything else on your mind.</p>
            <p>It’s now easier to negate any type of emotional negativity, such as stress, depression, and existential failure. This way, you can always be happy, relaxed, and fulfilled all of the time.</p>

            <p>Your phone is able to take care of you better than a friend or family member could.</p>

            <h3>An Integrative Experience</h3>
            <p>You can connect Lotus with some of your favorite apps, allowing them to respond to your current situation.</p>
            <p>For example, Tinder could tell that you’re still sad from your breakup and match you with another sad human so that you can attempt to fill the void in each other’s souls while you both secretly think about your exes.</p>

            <p>“Before, my phone had absolutely no idea how I was feeling. It had no idea if I was happy, having a bad day, stressed, or confused, and that got frustrating. Now, I feel like have an emotionally intelligent friend.” </p>
            <p>“I realized I was spending more hours with my smartphone than I did with any other human. I actually prefer this kind of intimacy.”</p>
            <p>“With an app that can read and respond to my emotions, personal needs, and existential concerns, who needs other people?”</p>
            <p>“It’s not like all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace.” </p>
            <p>“Using Lotus makes me feel happy, relaxed, and emotionally fulfilled. I never get stressed, angry, or upset anymore, as if I only have one mood.”</p>      
            <p>“I’ve always wondered what it would feel like to be happy all of the time for the rest of my life. Now, thanks to Lotus, I know.”</p>
